## Project Introduction

2024 has been a difficult year for entry-level data science jobs and for this project, I am interested in analyzing the data science field job market. For this project, I am utilizing a Kaggle-based dataset that web-scraped Canadian job postings for data using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. This dataset provides multiple interesting insights into the data science job market such as in-demand technical skills, expected work experience, and salary ranges.

| :------------- | :------------ |
| Job ID | Unique identifier for job post |
| Job Title | Name of current available job position |
| Company Name | Name of current hiring employer |
| Language and Tools | In-demand technical and soft skills listed in job posting |
| Job Salary | Payment amount offered for service |
| City | Workplace location |
| Province | Province of work location |
| Job Link | Link to original job board post |

## Objective

My objective for this project is to uncover what the data science job market seeking from new potential hires. Questions I am looking to answer are experience level employers are seeking, which technical skills are in demand, and which regions are hiring the most individuals.

## Analysis Outline
Within this exploratory data analysis, we are attempting to uncover new insights and unusual anomalies within the dataset. The key questions we are looking for are:

- What is the current salary range to expect for data science jobs in Canada?

- Which data science job positions are available and most in-demand? What salary amount can we expect from these positions?

- Does work experience affect job availability? What salary amount should be expected based on work experience?

- Which job board platform is the optimal platform when looking for a job?

- In data science, what are the most in-demand technical skills by employers?
    
- Which Canadian cities are the most in demand for on-site office personnel? How many total jobs are offered in each city?


## Conclusion

### Key Findings

•	Average salary for a data science career in Canada can range from  65k to 85k

•	Data analysts, business analysts, and general analysts 10x more in demand than data engineers and data scientists 

•	Businesses are looking to optimize business processes and consolidate their current market position rather than grow their market or market share

•	This is supported by the idea that many specified jobs are hiring specifically for experienced senior candidates over middle and entry-level candidates

•	Across all web platforms there is a 10x demand for senior roles than middle and entry-level roles

•	The most common skills employers expect from candidates are SQL, Python, Excel, and a business intelligence platform of which the most common are Power BI and Tableau

•	Geographically, the best locations for on-site jobs are the Toronto and Vancouver regions since they have multiple neighboring cities that are also looking to hire creating the two largest hubs for data science candidates
