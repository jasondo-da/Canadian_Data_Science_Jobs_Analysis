## Project Introduction

2024 has been a difficult year for entry-level data science jobs and for this project, I am interested in analyzing the data science field job market. For this project, I am utilizing a Kaggle-based dataset that web-scraped Canadian job postings for data using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. This dataset provides multiple interesting insights into the data science job market such as in-demand technical skills, expected work experience, and salary ranges.

## Objective

My objective for this project is to uncover what the data science job market seeking from new potential hires. Questions I am looking to answer are experience level employers are seeking, which technical skills are in demand, and which regions are hiring the most individuals.

## Analysis Outline
Within this exploratory data analysis, we are attempting to uncover new insights and unusual anomalies within the dataset. The key questions we are looking for are:

- What is the current salary range to expect for data science jobs in Canada?

- Which data science job positions are available and most in-demand? What salary amount can we expect from these positions?

- Does work experience affect job availability? What salary amount should be expected based on work experience?

- Which job board platform is the optimal platform when looking for a job?

- In data science, what are the most in-demand technical skills by employers?
    
- Which Canadian cities are the most in demand for on-site office personnel? How many total jobs are offered in each city?
